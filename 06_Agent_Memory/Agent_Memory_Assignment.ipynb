    "# Agent Memory: Building Memory-Enabled Investment Agents with LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore **agent memory systems** - the ability for AI agents to remember information across interactions. We'll implement all five memory types from the **CoALA (Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents)** framework while building a Stone Ridge Investment Advisory Assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "- Understand the 5 memory types from the CoALA framework\n",
    "- Implement short-term memory with checkpointers and thread_id\n",
    "- Build long-term memory with InMemoryStore and namespaces\n",
    "- Use semantic memory for meaning-based retrieval\n",
    "- Apply episodic memory for few-shot learning from past experiences\n",
    "- Create procedural memory for self-improving agents\n",
    "- Combine all memory types into a unified investment advisory agent\n",

      "Assistant: Given your profile and investment goals, I recommend a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your long-term growth objective while also generating income. Here’s a comprehensive approach tailored to your preferences and constraints:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Asset Allocation**\n",
      "   - **Equities (60%)**: Focus on a mix of growth and dividend-paying stocks to achieve long-term growth while generating income. Consider sectors that align with your ESG preferences, such as renewable energy, technology, and healthcare.\n",
      "   - **Bonds (40%)**: Invest in a combination of corporate bonds and government bonds. Look for bonds that have a good credit rating to balance risk and return. Consider green bonds or ESG-focused bond funds to align with your values.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Stock Selection**\n",
      "   - **Growth Stocks**: Allocate a portion to growth stocks that have strong fundamentals and potential for capital appreciation. Look for companies with a solid track record of revenue growth and innovation.\n",
      "   - **Dividend Stocks**: Include dividend aristocrats or companies with a history of increasing dividends. This will help in generating income while also providing some level of stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **ESG Considerations**\n",
      "   - Ensure that all investments comply with your ESG preferences. You can use ESG ratings to filter out companies that do not meet your criteria, particularly avoiding any tobacco-related stocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Risk Management**\n",
      "   - Given your moderate risk tolerance, consider using a diversified approach to mitigate risks. This includes diversifying across sectors and geographies.\n",
      "   - Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Rebalancing**\n",
      "   - Implement a rebalancing strategy to maintain your desired asset allocation. This could be done annually or semi-annually, depending on market conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. **Performance Metrics**\n",
      "   - Monitor your portfolio using the preferred metrics: CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), Sharpe ratio, and max drawdown. This will help you assess the performance and risk-adjusted returns of your investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 7. **Quarterly Reporting**\n",
      "   - Set up a quarterly review of your portfolio to evaluate performance against your goals and make adjustments as necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "This strategy aims to balance growth and income while adhering to your risk tolerance and ESG preferences. It’s essential to stay informed about market trends and adjust your strategy as needed over your 20-year investment horizon. If you have any specific sectors or funds in mind, or if you would like to discuss further details, feel free to ask!\n",

      "User (NEW thread): Are there any risks I should be aware of given my portfolio?\n",
      "Assistant: Given your portfolio's allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds, there are several risks to consider, especially in the context of your long-term growth and income generation goals, as well as your moderate risk tolerance:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Market Risk**: With a significant portion of your portfolio in stocks, you are exposed to market volatility. Economic downturns can lead to declines in stock prices, which may affect your long-term growth potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Interest Rate Risk**: Your bond allocation is subject to interest rate fluctuations. If interest rates rise, the value of existing bonds may decline, which could impact your income generation from this portion of your portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Inflation Risk**: Over a 20-year horizon, inflation can erode the purchasing power of your returns. While stocks generally provide a hedge against inflation over the long term, it's important to ensure that your bond investments are also positioned to mitigate this risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Sector and Geographic Concentration**: Depending on the specific stocks and bonds you hold, you may be exposed to sector-specific or geographic risks. Diversification across various sectors and regions can help mitigate this risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **ESG Risks**: Since you have an ESG preference, be aware that companies with strong ESG practices may perform differently than those that do not prioritize these factors. This could impact your portfolio's performance, especially if there are shifts in market sentiment towards sustainable investing.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Liquidity Risk**: While stocks are generally liquid, certain bonds or bond funds may have lower liquidity, which could be a concern if you need to access cash quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "To manage these risks, consider regularly reviewing your portfolio's performance against your goals and adjusting your asset allocation as needed. Additionally, maintaining a diversified portfolio and staying informed about market trends can help you navigate potential challenges.

      "\n",
      "1. **Bonds (50-60% of Portfolio)**: \n",
      "   - **Government Bonds**: Consider allocating a significant portion to U.S. Treasury bonds or high-quality municipal bonds. These are generally low-risk and can provide a steady income stream.\n",
      "   - **Corporate Bonds**: Look for investment-grade corporate bonds, which can offer higher yields than government bonds while still maintaining a conservative risk profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Dividend Stocks (30-40% of Portfolio)**: \n",
      "   - Focus on established companies with a strong history of paying dividends. Look for sectors like utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare, which tend to be more stable and less volatile.\n",
      "   - Consider dividend aristocrats—companies that have consistently increased their dividends for 25 years or more—as they can provide both income and potential for capital appreciation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Money Market Funds (10-20% of Portfolio)**: \n",
      "   - Allocate a portion to money market funds for liquidity and safety. This will help preserve capital while still earning a small return. It can also serve as a buffer against market volatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Diversification**: \n",
      "   - Ensure that your bond and stock selections are diversified across different sectors and maturities to mitigate risk. This will help protect your portfolio from sector-specific downturns.\n",

      "A: Given your profile, James, here’s a tailored investment strategy that aligns with your aggressive risk tolerance, long-term growth goals, and specific asset class preferences:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Growth Stocks (40% of Portfolio)**\n",
      "   - Focus on high-growth sectors such as technology, renewable energy, and biotechnology. Companies like **NVIDIA**, **Tesla**, and **Palantir** could be strong candidates. \n",
      "   - Consider investing in **small-cap growth stocks** as they often have higher growth potential compared to large-cap stocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Emerging Markets (30% of Portfolio)**\n",
      "   - Allocate a significant portion to emerging markets, which can offer higher returns due to their growth potential. Look into ETFs like **VWO (Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF)** or **EEM (iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF)**.\n",
      "   - You might also consider individual stocks in countries with strong economic growth, such as India or Brazil.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Cryptocurrency (20% of Portfolio)**\n",
      "   - Given your interest in crypto, consider allocating a portion to established cryptocurrencies like **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum**, as well as some smaller altcoins that have strong use cases and community support.\n",
      "   - Diversifying into crypto-related stocks or ETFs, such as **Coinbase** or **Grayscale Bitcoin Trust**, could also be beneficial.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Alternative Investments (10% of Portfolio)**\n",
      "   - Explore alternative investments such as **real estate investment trusts (REITs)** focused on growth sectors (e.g., data centers, logistics) or **peer-to-peer lending platforms**.\n",
      "   - Consider investing in **startups** or **venture capital funds** if you have access, as they can provide high returns, albeit with higher risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Additional Considerations:**\n",
      "- **Regular Rebalancing:** Given your long investment horizon of 30 years, it’s essential to regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.\n",
      "- **Stay Informed:** Keep an eye on market trends and economic indicators, especially in emerging markets and the crypto space, as these can be volatile.\n",
      "- **Tax Efficiency:** Consider tax-efficient investment accounts (like IRAs) to maximize your long-term growth potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Restrictions:**\n",
      "- Ensure that none of your investments are in tobacco or firearms companies, as per your restrictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "This strategy is designed to align with your aggressive risk tolerance and long-term growth goals while avoiding sectors you wish to exclude. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice and to ensure that your investments align with your overall financial plan.\n",

      "- **Real Estate:** This includes Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) or direct property ownership, which can provide rental income and capital appreciation.\n",
      "- **Private Equity:** Investing in private companies or funds that target private equity can offer high returns, though they often come with higher risk and longer investment horizons.\n",
      "- **Hedge Funds:** These funds employ various strategies to generate returns, including long/short equity, arbitrage, and global macro strategies.\n",
      "- **Commodities:** Investing in physical goods like gold, oil, or agricultural products can hedge against inflation and provide diversification.\n",
      "- **Cryptocurrencies:** Digital currencies can offer high volatility and potential returns, but they also come with significant risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Benefits of Alternative Investments:**\n",
      "- **Diversification:** They often have low correlation with traditional asset classes, which can reduce overall portfolio risk.\n",
      "- **Access to Unique Opportunities:** Alternatives can provide exposure to markets and sectors not available through traditional investments.\n",
      "- **Potential for Higher Returns:** Some alternatives may offer higher risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Considerations:**\n",
      "- **Liquidity:** Many alternative investments are less liquid than stocks and bonds, meaning it may take longer to sell your investment.\n",
      "- **Investment Horizon:** Some alternatives require a longer commitment, so consider your time frame and liquidity needs.\n",
      "- **Due Diligence:** Thorough research is essential, as these investments can be complex and may involve higher fees.\n",
      "- **Regulatory Environment:** Be aware of the regulatory landscape, especially for investments like cryptocurrencies or private equity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Typical Allocation:**\n",
      "A common recommendation is to allocate about 10-20% of your portfolio to alternative investments, depending on your risk tolerance and investment goals.\n",

      "User: How should I think about portfolio risk?\n",
      "\n",
      "Assistant (v1 instructions):\n",
      "Thinking about portfolio risk involves understanding several key concepts and factors that can influence the performance of your investments. Here are some important considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your personal risk tolerance, which is your ability and willingness to endure fluctuations in the value of your investments. This can be influenced by factors such as your investment goals, time horizon, and financial situation. Would you consider yourself conservative, moderate, or aggressive in your investment approach?\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Diversification**: Diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) and sectors can help mitigate risk. By spreading investments, you reduce the impact of a poor-performing asset on your overall portfolio. Have you considered how diversified your current portfolio is?\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Volatility**: Understand the volatility of the assets in your portfolio. Stocks, for example, tend to be more volatile than bonds. Higher volatility can lead to higher potential returns, but also greater risk of loss. Are you comfortable with the level of volatility in your current investments?\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Market Conditions**: Be aware of the current market conditions and economic indicators that can affect your investments. Factors such as interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical events can influence market performance. Are you keeping track of any specific economic indicators that concern you?\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Investment Horizon**: Your time horizon plays a crucial role in how you should approach risk. Longer investment horizons can often tolerate more risk, as there is more time to recover from market downturns. What is your investment time frame?\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Asset Allocation**: The way you allocate your assets can significantly impact your portfolio's risk profile. A well-thought-out asset allocation strategy can help balance risk and return based on your individual circumstances. Have you reviewed your asset allocation recently?\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Regularly reviewing and rebalancing your portfolio can help maintain your desired risk level. As market conditions change, your asset allocation may drift from your original plan. How often do you review your portfolio?\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Understanding Past Performance**: While historical performance can provide insights, it is essential to remember that past performance does not guarantee future results. Always consider the potential for both gains and losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "By considering these factors, you can develop a more comprehensive understanding of portfolio risk and make informed investment decisions. If you have specific investment goals or concerns, please share them, and I can provide more tailored advice.\n"

      "\n",
      "1. What is your risk tolerance? Are you more conservative, moderate, or aggressive in your investment approach?\n",
      "2. What are your investment goals? Are you looking for long-term growth, income generation, or capital preservation?\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Diversified Equity Funds**: Given the volatility in the stock market, consider investing in diversified equity funds or ETFs that focus on sectors with strong growth potential, such as technology, renewable energy, or healthcare. These sectors have shown resilience and growth potential, but be mindful of the inherent risks associated with equity investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Fixed Income Investments**: With interest rates rising, fixed income securities, such as bonds or bond funds, may offer attractive yields. Look for investment-grade corporate bonds or municipal bonds, which can provide a balance of risk and return. However, be aware that rising interest rates can negatively impact bond prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)**: REITs can provide exposure to real estate without the need to directly purchase property. They often offer attractive dividend yields and can act as a hedge against inflation. However, consider the economic environment and interest rate trends, as these can impact REIT performance.\n",

      "User: Can you tell me more about the alternative investments you mentioned?\n",

      "Assistant: Certainly! Alternative investments refer to asset classes that fall outside of traditional investments like stocks, bonds, and cash. They can provide diversification and potentially enhance returns, but they also come with unique risks. Here are some common types of alternative investments:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Real Estate**: Investing in physical properties or real estate investment trusts (REITs) can provide income through rent and potential appreciation in property value. However, real estate markets can be volatile and require active management.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Private Equity**: This involves investing in private companies or buyouts of public companies. While private equity can offer high returns, it typically requires a longer investment horizon and is less liquid than public equities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Hedge Funds**: These funds employ various strategies to generate returns, including long/short equity, arbitrage, and global macro. Hedge funds can be complex and often have high fees, but they may provide diversification and risk management.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Commodities**: Investing in physical goods like gold, oil, or agricultural products can hedge against inflation and provide diversification. However, commodity prices can be highly volatile and influenced by geopolitical factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Cryptocurrencies**: Digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained popularity as alternative investments. They can offer high potential returns but come with significant risk and regulatory uncertainty.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Actionable Insights:\n",
      "1. **Diversification**: Consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to alternative investments to reduce overall risk and enhance returns. A common recommendation is to limit alternatives to 10-20% of your total portfolio, depending on your risk tolerance.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Research and Due Diligence**: Before investing in alternatives, conduct thorough research to understand the specific risks and potential returns associated with each asset class. This includes understanding market trends and the economic factors that may impact performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consult a Professional**: Given the complexity of alternative investments, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help tailor an investment strategy that aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Important Note:\n",
      "Always remember that past performance does not guarantee future results, and alternative investments can be illiquid and may not be suitable for all investors.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we explored the **5 memory types** from the CoALA framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Memory Type | LangGraph Component | Scope | Investment Use Case |\n",
    "|-------------|---------------------|-------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **Short-term** | `MemorySaver` + `thread_id` | Within thread | Current consultation |\n",
    "| **Long-term** | `InMemoryStore` + namespaces | Across threads | User profile, goals, constraints |\n",
    "| **Semantic** | Store + embeddings + `search()` | Across threads | Investment knowledge retrieval |\n",
    "| **Episodic** | Store + few-shot examples | Across threads | Past successful interactions |\n",
    "| **Procedural** | Store + self-reflection | Across threads | Self-improving instructions |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory transforms chatbots into advisors** - Persistence enables personalization\n",
    "2. **Different memory types serve different purposes** - Choose based on your use case\n",
    "3. **Context management is critical** - Trim and summarize to stay within limits\n",
    "4. **Episodic memory enables learning** - Show, don't just tell\n",
    "5. **Procedural memory enables adaptation** - Agents can improve themselves\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `PostgresSaver` instead of `MemorySaver` for persistent checkpoints\n",
    "- Use `PostgresStore` instead of `InMemoryStore` for persistent long-term memory\n",
    "- Consider TTL (Time-to-Live) policies for automatic memory cleanup\n",
    "- Implement proper access controls for user data\n",
    "- Ensure compliance with financial regulations for investment advisory data\n",
