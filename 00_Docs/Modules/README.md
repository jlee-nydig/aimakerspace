# **🧑‍💻 What is Agent Engineering?**

AI Engineering refers to the industry-relevant skills that data science and engineering teams need to successfully **build, deploy, operate, and improve Large Language Model (LLM) applications in production environments**.

In 2026, AI Engineers are responsible for building agents.

[Agent Engineering](https://blog.langchain.com/agent-engineering-a-new-discipline/), an emerging discipline, is defined as the iterative process of refining non-deterministic LLM systems into reliable production experiences.

To get started with our Agent Engineering course, ensure that the preliminaries in [`00_Git_Setup`](./00_Git_Setup.md) are super clear to you, then proceed to [`01_Intro_and_Vibe_Check`](./01_Intro_and_Vibe_Check.md).
